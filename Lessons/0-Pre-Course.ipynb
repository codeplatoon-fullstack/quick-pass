    "A Python library is a collection of code included with the language that defines certain methods and also could define the nature of special data types.  For example, there is a `datetime` library that defines the behavior of `datetime` objects made to calculate or track dates or the passage of time.  Libraries are imported at the top of a python file and once the import statement is read, the methods in that library are able to be accessed.  We will go over several libraries in Quick Pass."

    "### Hard-Coding vs. Programmatic Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard-coding is when you type explicit values in your code. *Programmatic coding*, is using variables and methods wherever possible. By writing programmatic code, you make your scripts useful to others as well as yourself.  Programmatic code that contains appropriately named variables tends to be easier to read and is flexible to changes.  Below is some code blocks that are written with hard-coded values and an improved version below it replaced with appropriately named variables.  Even without adding comments, the code written with programmatic principles in mind is easier to read. It is also easier to change.  If we need to change the number of diners, we just need to change it in one location vs. four!\n"

    "## Problem Solving Strategies for Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "As a software developer, your daily grind involves tackling a myriad of puzzles. Whether you’re part of an application development team or working on your own project, problem-solving is at the core of what we do. Software engineeers are builders and the traditional end goal is to build a functional application—the grand challenge that takes months to crack. Building it can be defined as one big problem to solve, but that one problem contains hundreds or even thousands of smaller problems that we have to address. Take authentication, for instance. Let's say you are creating a module that validates user credentials to let them log-in. Sounds simple, right? Yet beneath the surface lie a cascade of smaller problems: data types, formatting, comparisons, validation, etc.  How can we address all of them in the right way?  That is where these techniques come into play."
